1. identify and isolate missing values and outliers
2. decide how to fill missing values or deal with outliers
3. is finding outliers same thing as idenfying anomalies? meaning only anomalies on power output values? wind speed and direction is also collected from sensors. are these correct?
4. for ml we need to identify correlation between wind speed, direction and power output. data should be brought on same scale


for power output missing or outlier
    - replace with average



what does 'appended daily' mean? every day csv is appended with data from previous day,
meaning to test pipeline I might need to simulate a new append and various scenarios of missing data or outliers though currently there is none
